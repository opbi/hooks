// especially when record needs to pass through filter to get to write stream
// batch would be on the write stream side, and update progress after batchWrite
//
// resume a progress on stream:
// notice that readstream is a buffer ahead of writestream
// it is necessary to rewind the position of the buffer size
// to resume at the accurate point

// position: after progress-add
// percentage in the meta should reflect the actual progress
// as progress.add would have sync to the moment the write function is triggered
//
// position: before/above progress-add
// percentage in the meta is one batch behind the actual progress
// as it is profiled before the function execution
// it is not possible to pass the updated progress before inputFunction call
// it is not recommended to position this decorator at this location
